# Advent of Code 2022
My attempts at the puzzles this year.

## My Approach
I'd love to get on the leaderboard, but I don't think there is as much value in some of the preparation required (using copilot/AI, deep exploration of seldom used Python features, writing specialized utility functions, getting really obsessed and sweaty, not writing bugs !!), as merely pacing myself and testing my problem solving and aiming for < 30 Min. I'm currently thinking of it as prep for short-timeframe projects or job interviews, and a fun countdown to the holidays.

### Usual Disclaimers
- I write better code than this in production, and not just to satisfy my cargo cult programming style.
- I cleaned up the solutions without fundementally changing them (in case I want to refer back)
- I only started playing in time to "race" on day 6, and I might stop anytime.

## Script Usage
Inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/alvesvaren/AoC-template), but
simpler for my grug brain:
- Run aoc.py to create the day folders, set year and session cookie.
- Running the code.py in each of the folders will get that day's input, caching
  it for you.
